              GarageNodeSpec defines the desired state of GarageNode.

              GarageNode represents a node in the Garage cluster layout. Use this resource when:

              1. GarageCluster.layoutPolicy is "Manual" - You must create GarageNode for each pod
              2. External nodes - Nodes outside this Kubernetes cluster (air-gapped, VMs, other K8s clusters)
              3. Fine-grained control - Different zones/capacities per node within the same cluster
              4. Gateway nodes - Nodes that handle API requests but don't store data

              When NOT to use GarageNode:
              - With layoutPolicy: "Auto" (default) - The controller auto-manages local pod layouts
              - For simple single-zone deployments - Let the controller handle it

              For multi-cluster federation, prefer using GarageCluster.remoteClusters with auto-discovery
              instead of manually creating GarageNode resources for each remote node.
